## Heirs ANV-1030
Key features of this power supply are as follows:
- Cheap yet feature-rich variable DC-DC power supply
- Aimed towards beginners as a DIY electronics project
- Comprehensive documentation 
- Adequate accuracy and performance for general electronics use
- Use of cost oriented and widely available components
- A linear topology without digital control for simplicity and low cost
- Complete set of protections (OVP, OCP, OTP, SCP)




This variable analog bench power supply is designed whilst taking into consideration the following requirements:
- A relatively low power step-down DC-DC converter
- No digital control component
- Fast charge USB output with voltage and current monitoring outputs
- An Entirely non-switching linear topology
- Current, voltage, I_SET and OVP_SET should be displayable via two 3rd party voltmeter modules
- For visual output we are gonna use 3rd-party off-the-shelf voltmeter modules which can be priced as low as 0.90$ each
